# RapidMiner Overview

This repository contains various material in support of the RapidMiner overview talk planned to be given to the Reading Data Science group in March 2019.

RapidMiner is an extremely powerful and easy to use environment for data science. The clue is in the name: RapidMiner. It really is the work of a few minutes to rapidly create a machine learning model without having to write any software. This talk will give a basic introduction and overview to allow a complete beginner to do just that; create a model. 

We will cover 

* Installation of RapidMiner Studio: Community Edition
* GUI features
* Creating a model
* Understanding the results 
* What to do next
